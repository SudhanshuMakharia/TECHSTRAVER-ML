# Machine Learning Internship at TechStraver - Project Overview

## Introduction

This repository contains the projects I completed during my machine learning internship at TechStraver. Over the course of the internship, I had the opportunity to work on three key tasks, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning and computer vision. This README file provides an overview of each project, including the task description, technologies used, and potential real-world applications.

## Task 1: Voice Command Recognition

### Description
The first task involved developing a voice command recognition system. The goal was to create a model capable of accurately recognizing and processing spoken commands, such as "turn on the light" or "set an alarm for 7 AM." This task required working with audio data, preprocessing it, and training a model to differentiate between various commands.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Librosa** (for audio processing)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for model training)
- **NLP Techniques** (for processing spoken language)

### Real-World Application
Voice command recognition systems are widely used in various applications, including virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), smart home devices, and hands-free control systems. This technology enables users to interact with devices through speech, enhancing accessibility and convenience.

## Task 2: Gender and Age Detection using OpenCV

### Description
The second task focused on developing a gender and age detection system using computer vision techniques. The project involved creating a model that could accurately determine the gender and estimate the age of individuals based on their facial features. This task required working with image data, applying facial detection algorithms, and training a model to make predictions.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for facial detection)
- **Deep Learning Models** (for gender and age prediction)

### Real-World Application
Gender and age detection systems have numerous applications, including in retail for targeted advertising, in security for identification purposes, and in social media for content filtering. These systems enhance the user experience by providing personalized services and improving security measures.

## Task 3: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

### Description
The third task involved developing a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The objective was to analyze historical stock data and create a model that could forecast future stock prices. This task required handling time series data, training an LSTM model, and evaluating its performance in predicting price trends.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for building and training the LSTM model)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for data visualization)

### Real-World Application
Stock price prediction models are crucial in the finance industry for making informed investment decisions. By predicting future price movements, these models can help traders and investors optimize their strategies, reduce risks, and increase profitability.

## Conclusion

This internship provided me with a deep dive into various machine learning and computer vision techniques, allowing me to work on projects with real-world applications. The skills and knowledge gained through these tasks have significantly contributed to my growth as a machine learning professional.
